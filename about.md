Welcome to the "Select Car by Horsepower, Transmission and Cyclinders" app, that was developed for the course Developing Data Products. This app helps you to choose a car based on Horsepower, Transmission and Cyclinders. It uses the mtcars dataset from [R].

The table will show only the cars with the Horsepower, Transmission and Cyclinders filters selected. You can sort the table according to the variable you want by clicking the arrows at the top of the table.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/ashtalks/dataproduct).
